Starting cycling in London can be daunting. You'll almost certainly have had someone telling you "its terrifying you wont catch me doing it" or worse yet had your ear chewed off about all the gear and kit you need to have to 'reeaaally be a cyclist in the city'. We're here to share that actually its really simple to start riding in London, and better yet, there are loads of free and fun resources to help you do it.

## Free Cycle Safety Training

Every single Borough in London provides free cycle safety training. One more time for those in the back, EVERY SINGLE BOROUGH IN LONDON PROVIDE FREE CYCLE SAFETY TRAINING. Find your local course for adult learners on the [TfL cycle skills site ](https://tfl.gov.uk/forms/12421.aspx)and head over to the [Bikeability](https://bikeability.org.uk/) for children's training and family sessions across London and the UK. There are also loads of local organisations set up to help their local communities learn to ride safely as well as those with a dedicated focus on supporting people with disabilities and neuro-diversity, like [Bikeworks](https://www.bikeworks.org.uk/).
