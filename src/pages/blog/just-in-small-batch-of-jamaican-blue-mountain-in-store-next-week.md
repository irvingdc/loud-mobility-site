Intro contect

## Getting on yer bike

Borrowed bike, Women of Colour Cycling Collective, a local park + someone trustedy Gap are located near the peak.

First day was just about sitting on the bike, 4ft nothing so a lot of seat adjustments

## Pedalling forward

first goes with support, getting comfortable with the pedals 

## Cycling Confident

free local course through council website, borrowed one of their bikes, better size etc..

While the training helped Rachel understand the basics of bike maintainance, she also learned the importance of regular services. Rachel opts for the subscriptions service to have her foldable bike serviced four times a year so the cost is predictable and no unexpected issues slow her roll. (add links to relevant services & explain why its helpful for her)
